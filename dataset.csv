For example, in a web framework, static dispatch can be used to ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors caused by mismatched types.', 'Dynamic dispatch, on the other hand, is often used when you need to support both static and dynamic types in the same code. For example, in a dynamic programming algorithm, you may use dynamic dispatch to determine the most efficient way to calculate the result.']"
